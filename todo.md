remake the like button on the guest recipe page

to my udnerstanding, create-new-password.php is unused.

dashboard.php is kinda lacking too.

add pagination to meal explorer

add search bar to search for recipes

add twitter, facebook and insta links

ok the thing i was trying to tell you at costco was that we need to add a filter recipe search option, as in, I want a VEGAN meal or a DAIRY FREE meal... 
- we prob wont get this done but if we do not bring it up, it will go by people's heads
